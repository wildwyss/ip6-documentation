\chapter{Results}
This chapter contains the results of the thesis. First, we look at the outcomes of the user test.
The results are encouraging and we take a closer look at some of them.
Then, small applications demonstrate the usage of the Sequence Library. The
examples show that the concepts and implementations presented in this thesis
are useful in different ways. The following section lists features that have not yet been
implemented. Finally, we will discuss the results obtained in this thesis. For
this purpose, we will take a closer look at the specific topics of this work.
Each topic briefly mentions what was achieved and where there were limits to
it.

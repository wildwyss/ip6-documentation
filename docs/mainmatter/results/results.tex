\chapter{Results}
This Chapter contains the results of the thesis. 
First, we look at the outcomes of the user test. The results are encouraging,
and we look closely at some of them. Then, applications demonstrate the usage
of the Sequence library. The examples show that the concepts and
implementations presented in this thesis are useful in different ways. The
following section lists features that have not
yet been implemented. 
Finally, we will discuss the results obtained in this thesis. For this purpose,
we will take a closer look at the specific topics of this work. We briefly highlight what was
achieved in each topic and any limitations encountered.

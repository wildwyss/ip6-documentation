This section is about formative sources for this thesis. The following briefly
introduces the sources and explains their meaning for this work.

\subsection{Why Functional Programming Matters}
\label{sub:Functional Programming Matters}

Why Functional Programming Matters~\cite{hughes_why_1989} by John Hughes gives
an impressive insight into functional programming, mainly higher-order
functions, and laziness is discussed intensively. The Sequence library, part of
the functional standard library, enables to rebuild many examples described in
this paper using JavaScript. This paper strongly influenced the development of
the standard library, as the described concepts had already been proven a long
time ago. In addition, the user test is based on an example of this paper. \\
Furthermore, this paper has improved the understanding of function composition,
partial application, and laziness. Therefore, this paper has enhanced the
quality and robustness of the Sequence library. Chapter~\ref{sec:Modularizing
Programs} deals with this topic in depth.

\subsection{Frege Goodness}
\label{sub:Frege Goodness}
Frege Goodness~\cite{frege_goodness} by Prof. Dierk KÃ¶nig is a book about
Frege, a functional programming language for the JVM. This book contains
examples and explanations of various applications. We gained new insights and
inspiration for implementations and examples based on these. We treated
individual chapters more intensively, such as \textit{The Power of the Dot}.
The insights gained helped to make far-reaching decisions for the Sequence
library. Chapter~\ref{sec:The Power of the Dot} describes more details about
that.

\subsection{Quickcheck}
\label{sub:Quickcheck}
QuickCheck: A Lightweight Tool for Random Testing of Haskell
Programs~\cite{quickcheck_hughes} by Koen Claessen and John Hughes describes
how property-based testing works in Haskell. The adaption of specific
approaches described by this paper improved the code quality of the Sequence
library. Since this project did not focus on this topic, we only took over a few
ideas. However, further implementations in this direction are possible.
Chapter~\ref{sub:A Kind of Property based Testing} discusses the adapted
concepts in more detail. 

\subsection{MDN - Iteration Protocols}
\label{sub:MDN - Iteration Protocols}
The Mozilla Firefox page describing the iteration
protocols~\cite{mdn_protocols} is the basis for developing the Sequence
library. The page contains all relevant facts about Iterable and Iterators.
Chapter~\ref{sec:Sequence and Iterable in General} explains the implementation
of protocols.

\subsection{LINQ}
\label{sub:LINQ}
LINQ (Language integrated queries)~\cite{billwagner_language-integrated_2023}
is a widely used concept for querying data. It enables to process differentd
data sources in a fluent and declarative way. Using this to solve problems is
convenient and easy to read and understand afterward. JINQ, which emerged in
this project, is based on the same ideas. LINQ heavily inspired the naming and
the scope of JINQ, enabling users familiar with LINQ to use JINQ immediately.
Chapter~\ref{sec:Query different Data Structures} discusses JINQ in detail.

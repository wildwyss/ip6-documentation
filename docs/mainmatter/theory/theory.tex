\chapter{Theory}
This chapter gives an introduction to the topic of the functional standard
library for the Kolibri Web UI Toolkit. We will briefly touch on what the 
Toolkit is and what values it represents. After that, we will consider how it
comes to developing a standard library and what place it takes in the
toolkit. We also explore the question of who the toolkit is actually for.
\newline
Subsequently, the most relevant sources are listed, which serve as research bases for the Thesis.
Each source is briefly described, and it is mentioned which parts have significantly 
contributed to the result of the thesis.
\newline
Finally, we look at which similar projects exist. We will see there are other
exciting implementations of similar concepts.

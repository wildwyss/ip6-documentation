This chapter introduces the project "A Functional Standard Library for the
Kolibri Web UI Toolkit". It begins by briefly describing the Kolibri toolkit
and its benefits. It then discusses the motivation for developing a standard
library for the toolkit and how it fits into the overall architecture. The
chapter then lists the most relevant sources that were used in the research for
this thesis, and briefly describes each source, highlighting the parts that
were most helpful. Finally, the chapter discusses other similar projects and
how the functional standard library differs from them.

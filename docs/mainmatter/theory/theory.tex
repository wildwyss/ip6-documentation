This chapter introduces the project work "A Functional standard library for the
Kolibri Web UI Toolkit". Initially, it briefly describes the Kolibri toolkit
and why it is useful. After that, it considers how it comes to developing a
standard library and what place it takes in the toolkit. \\ 
Subsequently, the most relevant sources are listed, which serve as research
bases for this thesis. Each source is briefly described, mentioning which parts
have significantly contributed to the thesis result. \\ 
Finally, the chapter shows which similar projects exist and how the functional
standard library differs from these.

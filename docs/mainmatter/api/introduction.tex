\label{sub:Sequence Library Overview}
This library~\cite{wildwyss_kolibri} consists of several parts. Table~\ref{tab:library_overview} gives a brief
overview of each of those. The following Sections discuss these different
aspects.

\begin{table}[H]

  \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| l | X |} \hline
    \textbf{Part} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
    Sequence library & The Sequence library provides operations for processing \lstinline{Iterable}s. Additionally, there are constructors to create Sequences.\\ \hline 
    JINQ & A range generates a sequence of numbers. \\ \hline 
    Stdlib & Extends the Kolibri standard library with additional features.\\ \hline 
    FocusRing & A FocusRing is an immutable data structure, whose elements are arranged in a ring. \\ \hline 
  \end{tabularx}
  \caption{The available operators in the Sequence library}
  \label{tab:library_overview}
\end{table}

\textit{Note:} The FocusRing results from the predecessor project and is only
listed here for completeness. The same applies to the Range, which is part of
the Sequence library. Please find more information in the documentation of
the previous work.~\cite{wild_ip5_2023}. 

\subsection{Including the Library in a Project} % (fold)
\label{sub:Including the Library in a Project}
This library is part of the Kolibri project~\cite{kolibri} and uses many of its
functionalities. The Kolibri ships this library, therefore. The Kolibri
is available on GitHub and can be included directly in existing projects via
the ES6 module system.

By studying this Chapter, a library user will get an overview of its features.
The provided code examples illustrate simple cases. Therefore, the reader will
only partially understand the concepts and background of the work when reading
this Chapter. Chapter~\ref{chap:development} provides a much deeper conceptual
understanding. \\ 
The Chapter starts with an overview of this library and explains how to import
it in your project. After that, it shows the whole API of the Sequence library,
JINQ and explains the additions to the Kolibri standard library. The Sequence
library is extensible with custom features - the end of this Chapter shows how
to achieve this.

\label{sec:api_reader_guidance}
By studying this Chapter, a library user will get an overview of its features.
The provided code examples illustrate simple cases. Therefore, the reader will
only partially understand the concepts and background of the work when reading
this Chapter. Chapter~\ref{chap:development} provides a much deeper conceptual
understanding. The Chapter starts with an overview of this library and how it
can be imported and used in your project. After that, it shows the whole API of
the Sequence library and JINQ. The Sequence library is extensible with custom
features - the end of this Chapter shows how to achieve this.

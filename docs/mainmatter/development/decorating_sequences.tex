\section{Decorating Sequences}
\label{sec:Decorating Sequences}
This chapter explores how to process Sequences by implementing the Decorator 
Pattern and effectively managing Sequence state. Discover powerful techniques 
to enhance Sequence functionality and manipulate data.

\subsection{Decorator Pattern}
\label{sub:Decorator Pattern}

Let us look at the Decorator Pattern~\cite{} to understand the content of the following sections.
In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a widely used concept. 
An object is decorated, as the name implies. As a result, an outer object refers 
to an inner object, and both implement the same interface. As a result, the 
outer object forwards requests to the inner one. It modifies the calls on 
demand to manipulate or decorate the functionality of the inner one. Figure
\ref{} shows how a decorator forwards the receiving calls and transfers the
answer back to the client.

  \draw[->] ($(Decorator)!0.35!(Decorator_ground)$) -- node[above,scale=1,midway]{operation()} ($(Decorated)!0.35!(Decorated_ground)$); 
  \draw[->] ($(Decorator)!0.35!(Decorator_ground)$) -- node[above,scale=1,midway]{operation()} ($(Decorated)!0.35!(Decorated_ground)$); 
  \draw[->] ($(Decorated)!0.55!(Decorated_ground)$) -- node[below,scale=1,midway]{returns} ($(Decorator)!0.55!(Decorator_ground)$);
  \draw[->] ($(Decorator)!0.65!(Decorator_ground)$) -- node[above,scale=1,midway]{calls} ($(Client)!0.65!(Client_ground)$); 
\end{tikzpicture}

The Decorator Pattern is often used in object-oriented programming languages 
because it adds additional functionality to an object at runtime. It is also 
possible to add extended functionality to a single object of a class. In the 
following, we will see how to exploit this to manipulate and change an Iterable.

\subsection{Processing Sequences}
\label{sec:Processing Sequences}
We use exactly that decorating approach to process Sequences further. 
The goal is to find a way to manipulate sequences so that they can solve 
complex problems. With many other programming languages it is possible to write
programs in this way. Lists and operations on lists solve numerous problems in 
computer science. This way of programming has the advantage that the structure 
of the code is declarative. This code is easier to understand and extend.

\subsubsection{Manipulate Iteratbles with Functions}

In the following, |map| serves as a representative for any function of the
Sequence library.
Listing~\ref{lst:impl_map} shows how |map| processes a Sequence. 
For this, we use the Decorator approach just mentioned. To keep the example 
simple, on Line~\ref{line:seq_definition} a client calls the map function with a Sequence of numbers. But it
could process any kind of iterables.
\newline
On line~\ref{line:args}, the function signature shows that a client can invoke 
|map| with two arguments: a mapper-function capable of processing an element of
an iterable and an iterable itself. An iterable must adheres to the protocol outlined in 
Section~\ref{subsub:The Iterable Protocol}. As a result, map can process 
Sequences, Arrays or any other iterable. 

\begin{lstlisting}[
  style=ES6, 
  caption=Implementation of map,
  label={lst:impl_map}
  ]
const map = mapper => iterable => { *'\label{line:args}'*
*'\label{line:state_iterable}'*
const mapIterator = () => {
   const inner = iteratorOf(iterable);*'\label{line:state_iterator}'*
   let mappedValue;
 
   const next = () => {
     const { done, value } = inner.next();*'\label{line:inner_next}'*
     if (!done) mappedValue = mapper(value);
 
     return { /**@type boolean */ done, value: mappedValue }
   };
 
   return { next };
  };
 
  return createMonadicSequence(mapIterator);
};

const sequence = Sequence(0, x => x < 10, x => x++);*'\label{line:seq_definition}'*
const mapped   = map(x => x * 2)(sequence);*'\label{line:obj_mapped}'*
\end{lstlisting}

Because map decorates iterables, |map| also returns an object of type Iterable. 
We define this object on line~\ref{line:obj_mapped} as mapped. 
Consequently, |map| also has a next function. Since the Iterable protocol 
specifies only this single function, it is the only one that must be externally 
callable. The object mapped now forwards function calls of the next function to 
the inner iterable, on line~\ref{line:inner_next}. The mapper function then processes the 
result and returns it.

\subsection{Benefits form the Decorater Approach}
\label{sub:Benefits form the Decorater Approach}
This section discusses the benefits and consequences of using the Decorator Pattern 
to implement the Sequence Library.

\subsubsection{Standalone Functions}
\label{subsub:Standalone Functions}
In an object-oriented approach, the Sequence object defines the functions to 
process the elements. Functions are available by using dot notation. Similar to 
Java implements the Stream API. However, with the approach of programming the 
functions independently, there are three significant advantages:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item {Strict adherence to the open-close principle. Changes to a function do
      not affect the implementation of Sequence. Also, extensions to the 
      Sequence library do not affect existing code.
    }
  \item{Adherence to the single responsibility approach. The Sequence 
      constructor has only the task of creating a sequence. Mapping the
    elements of a sequence is not its responsibility.
  }
  \item{Easy scalability is guaranteed. It is very straightforward to add new 
    functionality from the outside.
  }
\end{enumerate}

Due to the independent implementation of the functions, the last parameter can 
be the iterable object. The functions therefore define the parameters in curried 
style. Therefore, it is possible to benefit from eta-reduction in different
situations.

\subsection{Stateful Decorating}
\label{sub:Stateful Decorating}
A state is present as soon as functions decorate iterables or implement 
additional functionalities. This chapter is about where the functions implement 
this state and which consequences this implies.

There are two possible locations to bring state in. 
Both variants are possible and is content of the following two scenarios. 
The first scenario places the state into the closure scope of the surrounding 
function of the iterator. The second scenario implements the state into the 
closure scope of the iterator.
For both variants it is of great relevance that the underlying object must not 
be changed.

\subsubsection{Scenario 1}
Listing~\ref{lst:scen_1} shows that the state is on line~\ref{line:scen_1_state}.
The state is created by calling SampleIterator and is valid for the entire 
object's lifetime. 

\begin{lstlisting}[
  style=ES6, 
  caption=Scenario 1 - State in closure scope of iterable,
  label={lst:scen_1}
  ]
const SampleIterable = () => {

  let i = 0; *'\label{line:scen_1_state}'*
  const next = () => {
    return { done: i > 5, value: i++ };
  };

  const copy = ...

  return {[Symbol.iterator]: () => ({ next })}
};
\end{lstlisting}

Listing~\ref{lst:scen_1_demo} shows a possible program flow. An object is created 
and then partially processed. On line~\ref{line:scen1_map} |map| uses the same 
object as well. Line~\ref{line:scen1_output} shows an expected result. 
Nevertheless, copying the object before processing is necessary to achieve this 
result. That implies that each sequence must be copyable. Generating a new 
sequence with the same parameters allows for creating a copy of the sequence. 
The same is true for any function that decorates a sequence.

\begin{lstlisting}[
  style=ES6, 
  caption=Scenario 1 - Example usage,
  label={lst:scen_1_demo}
  ]
const seq = SampleIterable(0, x => x < 5, x => x++); // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
const mapped = map(id)(seq); *'\label{line:scen1_map}'*

for (const elem of mapped) {
  break; // Just consuming one element
}
for (const elem of seq) {
  console.log(elem);
}
// => Logs: '[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]' *'\label{line:scen1_output}'*
\end{lstlisting}

In many respects, copying is an elaborate thing. All functions and constructors 
dealing with sequences must implement it. Thus, implementation errors are 
possible. On the other hand, it is also an extra effort from a performance point 
of view. It means more function calls and also giant stack calls to manage.
The advantage of this implementation is that partially processed iterators could 
be further used with the current state because they do not reinitialize the 
state with a new iteration.
Because all objects must have copy implemented, Sequence Library functions can 
only process objects that implement copy. That means JavaScipt array or HTML 
Collection would not be processable.

\subsubsection{Scenario 2}
Listing~\ref{lst:scen_2} represents scenario 2. Here, the state is on 
line~\ref{line:scen_2_state}. Running the code from the previously
Listing~\ref{lst:scen_1_demo} produces the same result. The difference is that 
the object does not have to be copyable. Each call to |Symnol.iterator| creates
a new object. This type of iterator is immutable. As a consequence, 
copying is not necessary. Another advantage is that all functions of the 
Sequence Library can process objects with the |Symbol.iterator| property, such 
as an JavaScipt array.

\begin{lstlisting}[
  style=ES6, 
  caption=Scenario 2 - State in closure scope of iterator,
  label={lst:scen_2}
  ]
const SampleIterable2 = () => {

  return {
    [Symbol.iterator]: () => {
      let i = 0; *'\label{line:scen_2_state}'*
      return {
        next: () => ({ done: i > 5, value: i++ })
      }
    }
  };
};
\end{lstlisting}

In this chapter, we have examined the possibilities for adding State to 
sequences. Due to the advantages of immutability, we built the sequence library 
according to Scenario 2.

This chapter describes in detail the concepts behind the results of this
thesis. In contrast to Chapter~\ref{chap:api}, it is not a matter of defining
the whole API of this library in breadth but of presenting the background and
considerations understandably. \\
The first part of this chapter describes how iterables work in JavaScript and
what a sequence is in the context of this project. Then it shows how to use the
Decorator Pattern to build functions available to all iterables. \\ 
The second part shows how programs can be better structured using approaches
found in functional programming languages. These approaches allow the adoption
of abstract and strong concepts from Haskell to JavaScript. \\ 
The final part is devoted to testing - how to test different functions with
similar requirements safely and why tests based on invariants are helpful.

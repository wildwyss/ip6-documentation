	abstract = {As software becomes more and more complex, it is more and more important to structure it well. Well-structured software is easy to write and to debug, and provides a collection of modules that can be reused to reduce future programming costs. In this paper we show that two features of functional languages in particular, higher-order functions and lazy evaluation, can contribute signiﬁcantly to modularity. As examples, we manipulate lists and trees, program several numerical algorithms, and implement the alpha-beta heuristic (an algorithm from Artiﬁcial Intelligence used in game-playing programs). We conclude that since modularity is the key to successful programming, functional programming oﬀers important advantages for software development.},
